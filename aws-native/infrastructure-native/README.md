# Welcome to the CDK Java project for function-aws-native-springone!

The corresponding function configuration example _function-aws-native-springone_ defines function 
configuration and POM configured for GraalVM Native packaging. It consists of a single function.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) based project, so you can open this project with any Maven compatible Java IDE to build and run tests.

After installing and configuring AWS CDK environment as described [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/?nc1=h_ls), simply run

```
cdk deploy

```

. . . which will build your project and deploy it to your instance of AWS.

## Other useful commands

 * `mvn package`     compile and run tests
 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
